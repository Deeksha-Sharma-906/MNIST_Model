# MNIST Digit Classification Model
Handwritten digits decoded with deep learning

This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful **deep learning model** trained on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), which contains **70,000 handwritten digit images (0‚Äì9)** in grayscale (28x28 pixels).  

The goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits using a **Neural Network / CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** implemented in Python.
